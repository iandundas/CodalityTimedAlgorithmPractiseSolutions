# Codality Timed Algorithm Practise Solutions

My attempts at the timed programming challenges here https://codility.com/programmers/lessons

## Lessons:
### Iterations

1. BinaryGap ([score: 80%](https://codility.com/demo/results/trainingBWEAMQ-83G/))
Find longest sequence of zeros in binary representation of an integer.

### Arrays

1. CyclicRotation ([score: 100%](https://codility.com/demo/results/trainingGBGCAQ-UTA/))
Rotate an array to the right by a given number of steps.

2. OddOccurrencesInArray ([score](https://codility.com/demo/results/trainingZA7327-UGD/): 100%), 
Find value that occurs in odd number of elements.

### Time Complexity

1. FrogJmp ([score: 100%](https://codility.com/demo/results/trainingAHFH4B-NAM/))
Count minimal number of jumps from position X to Y.

2. TapeEquilibrium ([score: 100%](https://codility.com/demo/results/trainingV9ZB2W-GC6/#task-0))
Minimize the value |(A[0] + ... + A[P-1]) - (A[P] + ... + A[N-1])|.
